## Currency сonverter bot for telegram
This is a simple currency converter for telegram written in C++
This is my first telegram bot, so the quality of the code may not be the best
## Libraries
For the bot, I used the library [tg-bot-cpp](https://github.com/reo7sp/tgbot-cpp) and other [dependencies](https://github.com/reo7sp/tgbot-cpp#dependencies) of this library
## Currencies
To get the exchange rate, I used the data from the [site](https://www.cbr-xml-daily.ru/daily_json.js)
But due to the fact that there is a double currency conversion and therefore the bot is not accurate
